# Pseudorandom_number_generators_and_calculating_integrals_using_the_monte_carlo_method
In the montecarlo package there is a class that calculates the values of the signed integrals.
In the package relations there is a class that computes the value of square functions.
In the packagegenerators there is a few class for pseudorandom number generate, For example, by means of the unit distribution.
